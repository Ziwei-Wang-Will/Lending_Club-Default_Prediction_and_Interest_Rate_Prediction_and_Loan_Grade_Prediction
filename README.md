## Project Objectives

- For Lending club, it's extremely important to know how's the loan repayment capacity for each loan applicant, and how much interest rate should be assigned to each loan application appropriately. 
    - Firstly, knowing the loan repayment capacity for each loan applicant could help it decide whether to "accept" or "deny" a loan application. 
    - Second, evaluating interest rate precisely could bring an additional incentive for those who are willing to "lend" money and also attain a balance between demand (borrowers) and supply (lenders).
- As a result, some suitable metrics must be determined by looking at the dataset.
    - **Metrics**
        - loan status: To evaluate the loan repayment capacity for each loan applicant.
        - grade: A good categorical index to know the loan repayment capacity.
        - interest rate: A numerical feature playing a role of balancing demand and supply. 
- In our work, we bulid models to predict **Default**, **Interest Rate** and **Loan Grade**.

### 2. Data_Preprocessing_and_Feature_Engineering
- Goal
    - Three interesting problems (demonstrated as columns below) can be solved given this dataset.
        - grade
        - int_rate
        - loan_status
    - For this section, I mainly focus in 'loan_status'. 
        - My goal is trying to predict the loan repayment capacity for each loan applicant of each loan application. Furthermore, I started by creating a boolean type of 'loan_status'.
        - Create 'loan_status_binary', my target response variable 
        - 0 means a loan_status is either 'Fully Paid' or 'Current'
        - 1 means the rest values of loan_status

    - Categorical features
        - Deal with categorical features containing at least 80% NA values.
            - 12 categorical type features contain 80% of NA values.
            - Irrelevant features
                - Summary: One feature contain no information in the dataset.
                - Features
                    - id: A unique LC assigned ID for the loan listing. (107864 NA values)
                - NA imputation: drop off irrelevant features.
            - Hardship related features
                - Summary: Only one record available in hardship related features. Thus, these features might have lower feature importance on the response variable.
                - Features
                    - Non datetime type
                        - hardship_type: Describes the hardship plan offering.
                        - hardship_reason: Describes the reason the hardship plan was offered.
                        - hardship_status: Describes if the hardship plan is active, pending, canceled, completed, or broken.
                        - hardship_loan_status: Loan Status as of the hardship plan start date.
                    - Datetime type

                            - For example, if a borrower has a hardship plan period of 3 months, the start date is the start of the three-month period in which the borrower is allowed to make interest-only payments.
                - NA imputation: 
                    - Non datetime type: Replace NA values with a new level signifying NA values.
                    - Datetime type: Compared itself with the issue_d to create a new set of day difference features and then replace NA values with a NA level.
            - Settlement related features
                - Summary: Only nine records available in settlement related features. Thus, these features might have lower feature importance on the response variable.
                - Features
                    - Non datetime type
                        - settlement_status: The status of the borrower’s settlement plan. Possible values are: COMPLETE, ACTIVE, BROKEN, CANCELLED, DENIED, DRAFT.

        - Other categorical features containing at least one NA value.
            - 6 categorical type of features contain NA values.
            - Month type features
                - Summary
                    - Three datetime type features found in this step. 
                    - It's more reasonable to transform these features into the day difference between itself and issue day or into the day difference between itself and a benchmark date. 
                    - We are not sure whether the day difference is a great feature to explain a linear relationship with the response variable (requires a linear assumption). 
                    - We can also further do grouping on day difference features by creating bins (create a categorical type of feature).
                - Features
                    - last_pymnt_d: Last month payment was received
                    - next_pymnt_d: Next scheduled payment date
                    - last_credit_pull_d: The most recent month LC pulled credit for this loan.
                - NA imputation:
                    - last_pymnt_d: compare itself with issue_d
                        - The minimum day difference between last payment day and issue day is 0
                        - The maximum day difference between last payment day and issue day is 212
                        - The difference between each level is around 3 months, and we will have 8 levels (categorical feature)
                    - next_pymnt_d: compare itself with issue_d
                        - The minimum day difference between next payment day and issue day is 184
                        - The maximum day difference between next payment day and issue day is 273
                        - The difference between each level is around 3 months, and we will have 6 levels (categorical feature)
                    - last_credit_pull_d: compare itself with the maximum value in issue_d
                        - The difference between each level is around 1 months, and we will have 10 levels (categorical feature)
            - The rest of features
                - emp_title
                    - Description: The job title supplied by the Borrower when applying for the loan.    
                    - NA imputation:
                        - Originally, emp_title has 37289 levels. 
                        - Use a basic string preprocessing to lower down levels. 
                        - For each title, extract the last element splitting by the space and lowercase it. 
                        - Then, find top k levels to include as much information as we can and specify all the rest of levels as the NA level.
                            - Use top 20 levels to include 56% information and specify the rest levels as 'Other titles'
                - emp_length
                    - Description: Employment length in years. Possible values are between 0 and 10 where 0 means less than one year and 10 means ten or more years.
                    - NA imputation: Replace NA values with a new NA level.
                - revol_util
                    - Description: Revolving line utilization rate, or the amount of credit the borrower is using relative to all available revolving credit.      
                    - NA imputation: Replace NA values with the median value.                   
- Feature transformation
    - Datetime type features transformation
        - Summary: Still, there are other datetime type features needed to be deal with. They could be important features after the transformation.
        - issue_d
            - Description: The month which the loan was funded.
            - Transformation: compare itself with the maximum value (2018-03-01) in itself. (Using the same benchmark day to avoid a biased outcome.)
        - earliest_cr_line
            - Description: The month the borrower's earliest reported credit line was opened. 
            - Transformation: compare itself with the maximum value (2018-03-01) in issue_d. (Using the maximum value in issue_d as a benchmark to compare with earliest_cr_line is reasonable because if the day difference is larger, it might indicate that a loan applicant had a long credit history before, which might further indicate that a loan applicant could fully paid a loan application with a higher probability.)
